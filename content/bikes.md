Bikes
=====

We sell new and used bikes (when
available).

We carry new bikes in stock from [Kona][kona], [Bianchi][bianchi], [Jamis][jamis], [Salsa][salsa], [Raleigh][raleigh], and [Surly][surly] Additionally, we deal in [Redline][redline] and [Volagi][volagi], primarily through special order and custom builds. With those eight brands, we are able to offer nearly every type of bike available on the market. From Mountain Bikes, to Road Bikes, to Hybrid/Fitness Bikes, Commuter Bikes, Kids Bikes and Fat Bikes. You name it. We either have it or can build the bicycle that fits your needs.

Once we determine your preferred riding style (speed, fitness, commuting, etc.), we'll take you over to several models which will suit your needs.  From there, we'll get you sized and send you out for a few test rides.  Based on your feedback we'll narrow the models down to what felt most comfortable and appealed to you the best. After that, we'll make a few more adjustments and send you out for another test ride. All that's left is to get the fit dialed in just right and set you up with any accessories you need for safe and fun rides! This typically includes a helmet, gloves, multi-tool, hydration (cage/bottle or pack), pump, tube and storage.

In order to keep your new wheels out on the roads and trails, we offer an unbelievable _free lifetime maintenance policy_ on every new bike we sell.  This includes all basic maintenance such as shifter adjustments, brake adjustments, wheel truing and bearing adjustments.
