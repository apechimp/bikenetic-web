Service
=======

The other thing we're known for besides our new bike maintenance policy! If
you purchased your bicycle elsewhere, we will provide you with our
outstanding service at a reasonable rate in the shortest amount of time
possible.

Our service facility is located conveniently inside our back door entrance
right from the parking lot. Our dedicated service check-in counter means
you will talk with someone who understands bicycle repair when you arrive
and provide recommendations on what your bike will need to hit the trails
safely and securely.
