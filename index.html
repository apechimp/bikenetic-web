  <section id="who">
  First and foremost, we're a bunch of bicycle enthusiasts and try to be far more than just another "bike shop." For us cycling is a lifestyle, a passion and arguably the single most efficient mode of transportation on the planet - all that and it helps keep us healthy!

We offer free advice, a leg stretching lounge and a variety of bikes, products and services to suit most needs.

Please stop in or give us a call to find out more about how we can help you get into the sport - or - If you're lucky enough to already be hooked, give us a chance to show you how we do things here; fairly, competively and efficiently!

Sales:

Bikenetic is a full service bicycle shop. We sell new and used bikes (when available).

We carry new bikes in stock from Kona, Bianchi, Jamis and Surly. Additionally, we deal in Redline and Salsa, primarily through special order and custom builds. With those six brands, we are able to offer nearly every type of bike available on the market. From Mountain Bikes, to Road Bikes, to Hybrid/Fitness Bikes, Commuter Bikes, Kids Bikes and Fat Bikes. You name it, we either have it or can build the bicycle that fits your needs.

Once we determine your preferred riding style (speed, fitness, commuting, etc.), we'll take you over to several models which will suit your needs. From there, we'll get you sized and send you out for a few test rides. Based on your feedback we'll narrow the models down to what felt most comfortable and appealed to you the best. After that, we'll make a few more adjustments and send you out for another test ride. All that's left is to get the fit dialed in just right and set you up with any accessories you need for safe and fun rides! This typically includes a helmet, gloves, multi-tool, hydration (cage/bottle or pack), pump, tube and storage.

In order to keep your new wheels out on the roads and trails, we offer an unbelievable FREE LIFETIME MAINTENANCE policy on every new bike we sell. This includes all basic maintenance such as shifter adjustments, brake adjustments, wheel truing and bearing adjustments. 

Service:

The other thing we're known for besides our new bike maintenance policy! If you purchased your bicycle elsewhere, we will provide you with our outstanding service at a reasonable rate in the shortest amount of time possible.

Our service facility is located conveniently inside our back door entrance right from the parking lot. Our dedicated service check-in counter means you will talk with someone who understands bicycle repair when you arrive and provide recommendations on what your bike will need to hit the trails safely and securely.
